# 21booksearch
a book search engine Challenge

The motivation and the reason I built this code was to take a fully functioning Google Books API search engine built with a RESTful API, and refactor it to be a GraphQL API built with Apollo Server.  This was for an educational experience for me.

I am in the process of learning Appollo.  Once I get the full understanding I will have this down and update the code.   

This is a work in progress, this code is not complete.
